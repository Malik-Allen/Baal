# Baal
A performant and customizable renderer built using the Vulkan API.

## Goals
- To explore graphics programming and learn about the major topics in the medium. 
- Develop a high-performance and customizable renderer, that could be used for game and simulation engines.

## Practical Outcomes
These are the outcomes that I want from this renderer:
- Ability to load/unload 3d models
- Cubemaps
- Post-process effects
- Ability to load/unload Textures
- Create and use GLSL shaders
- MVP for the application/use-case of the Mjolnir Math Library
- Multi-sampling
- Double/Triple buffering
- Exploring PBR
- Lighting
- Simple implementation of ImGUI
- A go to resource for my Graphics explorations

# Dependancies
Dependancies should be present in an adjascent directory to the parent directory of this project, I don't want to use submodules for this work flow, at this time.
