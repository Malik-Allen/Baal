# Baal
A vulkan renderer I will never make from scratch again

## Outcomes
These are the outcomes that I want from this renderer:
- 3D objects
- To create planes in 3D space
- Cubemaps
- Load and unload Textures
- Create shaders in GLSL or HLSL
- Simple UI
- Simple Camera

# Improvements
- Multi-sampling
- Seperate Pipeline creation (Skybox, static meshes, dynamic meshes)
- Semaphore and Fence pool
- Multiple Frame in flight/being processed while another frame is presented

# Dependancies
